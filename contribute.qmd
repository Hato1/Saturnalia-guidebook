  <li>Show pre-requisites for clues, for example 'must be playing as Claudia'</li>
  <li>Add images for all clues</li>
  <li>Add quest guides for the playable characters + tecla + town quest</li>
  <li>Endgame scoreboard rules</li>
  <li>Achievement guides</li>
  <li>Quest guides, for spoiler free hints at what to do next</li>
  <li>Characters page, listing lore and character abilities</li>
</ul>
